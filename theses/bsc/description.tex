    \section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
    Abstract syntax trees (AST) are used in compilers and similar programs to represent
    the structure of a program as a tree data structure. As with any other tree structure,
    ASTs can be traversed, searched, sorted and so forth. During such operations,
    subtrees within the AST are potentially checked for equality many times.
    
    Because ASTs represent the structure of programs, equality checks usually happen on a structural level.
    Structural equality checking of subtrees is done recursively as we have to compare not only the roots, but also their children. This may add unexpected performance costs,
    especially considering the depth of ASTs representig big programs. Moreover, equality checks
    also occur in operations on collections of AST subtrees, which may add an additional performance overhead.

    The goal of this thesis is to improve the performance of AST subtree equality checks
    without burdening developers with additional boilerplate implementations.
    
    \section{Background}

    \subsection{Viper and Silicon} \label{background:viper}
    
    Viper \cite{viper} is a verification infrastructure on top of which verification tools
    for different programming languages can be built. Silicon \cite{silicon} is a backend for Viper,
    which is based on symbolic execution. To advance program verification in practice,
    fast verification is cruicial as it provides a more streamlined experience for developers.
    This is the reason why one of Silicon's stated goals is performance:

    \begin{quote} 
        ``The verifier should enable an IDE-like experience: it should be
        sufficiently fast such that users can continuously work on verifying
        programs [...]'' \cite{silicon}
    \end{quote}

    Silicon internally builds an AST from the Viper input
    program. This AST is potentially checked for structural equality many times within
    the execution of Silicon, and as such has the properties described in section \ref{introduction}.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, caption=Example of multiple subtree (``term'') equality checks occuring during the execution of Silicon.]
// args is of type Seq[Term], meaning we compare a list of
// terms within a sort function which is called many times
// during the sorting process.
relevantChunks.sortWith((ch1, ch2) => {
        // ...
        ch1.args == args
})
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsection{Scala and IntelliJ} \label{background:scala}

    The Viper infrastructure is written in the scala programming language.
    Scala has support for metaprogramming using macros. For a nice programming experience
    using macros, IDE support should ideally be provided. In this case, we use the IntelliJ IDE.
    However, Scala macros are not supported natively by the IntelliJ IDE:
    \begin{quote}
        ``Since IntelliJ IDEA’s coding assistance is based on static code analysis,
        the IDE is not aware of AST changes, and can’t provide appropriate code
        completion and inspections for the generated code.'' \cite{intellij}
    \end{quote}

    To ensure support for macros, a macro-specific IntelliJ plugin would have to be developed such that
    IntelliJ properly picks up macro-generated code.

    \section{Approach}

    \subsection{Implementation of Flyweight ASTs} \label{approach:flyweight}

    In a first step, we evaluate the performance of the Silicon backend,
    which allows us to relate possible performance improvements to 
    changes made during this project. We use existing benchmarking infrastructure 
    and, if necessary, create new benchmarks and benchmarking tools.
    
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, caption=Simplification of how term instances currently are created when applying a term.]
case class Plus(val p0: Term, val p1: Term) extends Term

// Companion object to the "Plus" case class.
object Plus {
    // The apply method Allows us to use the notation 
    // "Plus(e0, e1)" instead of "new Plus(e0, e1)".
    def apply(e0: Term, e1: Term) = {
        // ...
        new Plus(e0, e1)
    }
}
    \end{lstlisting}

    We can't avoid equality checks themselves, but what we can do is implementing
    equality checks in a more performant way. Currently in Silicon, every time a term is applied,
    a new instance of this term is created. Subterm equality is checked in a
    recursive manner.
        
    Because the AST used in Silicon is immutable, we can utilize the flyweight pattern \cite{patterns} on AST terms.
    To do this, we maintain a pool of term instances. Whenever a term
    is applied, we first compare the new term that is to be created with our
    pool of existing terms. If a structurally equal term already exists, we
    avoid creating a new instance of this term and instead return a reference to the
    equal object in the pool.

    This gives us the guarantee that there are no two instances of the
    same term in our pool, i.e. every two structurally equal terms point to the same
    underlying object in memory. Comparing terms for structural equality boils
    down to a cheap reference equality check, and recursive equality checks can be avoided.
    
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, caption=Avoid instantiating multiple structurally equal terms using the flyweight pattern.]
class Plus private (left: Term, right: Term) extends Term {
    // ...
}

object Plus extends ((Term, Term) => Term) {
    // Pool object which holds our "Plus" terms.
    val pool = new HashMap[(Term, Term), Term]

    def apply(e0: Term, e1: Term) = {
        pool.get((e0, e1)) match {
            // If this term already exists in pool, return it. 
            case Some(term) => term
            // Otherwise, create a new instance.
            case None => {
                val term = new Plus(e0, e1)
                pool.addOne((e0, e1), term)
                term
            }
        }
    }

    // ...
}
    \end{lstlisting}

    The \texttt{Plus} constructor is now private, which makes it impossible to
    create \texttt{Plus} instances without checking the pool first. The companion
    object \texttt{Plus} now contains a pool of all existing \texttt{Plus} instances. Furthermore,
    \texttt{Plus} is no longer a case class, which means that the default \texttt{equals}
    method no longer recursively checks for structural equality, but instead
    simply does a reference equality check. Because Scalas equality operator (\texttt{==})
    and datastructures like \texttt{HashMap} use the \texttt{equals} method behind
    the scenes, this will most likely lead to performance improvements.

    \subsection{Automate Boilerplate Generation using Macros} \label{approach:macros}

    Silicons AST representation of the Viper language consists of nearly 100 different terms.
    Many of these terms are case classes using compiler-generated \texttt{equals} and \texttt{apply} methods.
    Others are classes with their own companion objects manually defined,
    including custom \texttt{equals} and \texttt{apply} methods.
    Additionally, our changes introduce more boilerplate code that has to be written manually
    for every term.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, caption=The \texttt{apply} method of the \texttt{Plus} class additionally defines AST reductions. Together with our planned changes the amount boilerplate code will increase significantly.]
class Plus private (left: Term, right: Term) extends Term {
    // ...
}
        

object Plus extends ((Term, Term) => Term) {
    import predef.Zero

    val pool = new HashMap[(Term, Term), Term]

    def apply(e0: Term, e1: Term) = {
        (e0, e1) match {
            case (t0, Zero) => t0
            case (Zero, t1) => t1
            case (IntLiteral(n0), IntLiteral(n1)) =>
                IntLiteral(n0 + n1)
            case _ => pool.get((e0, e1)) match {
                case Some(term) => term
                case None => {
                    val term = new Plus(e0, e1)
                    pool.addOne((e0, e1), term)
                    term
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // ...
}
    \end{lstlisting}

    Our ASTs shouldn't only be flyweight in the sense of the development pattern, but also
    regarding development time and effort. This is why we want to avoid such boilerplate
    code and instead automatically generate companion objects using Scalas macro annotations.
    Additional benefits of using macro annotations include improvements in code
    readability and maintainability. Terms which may be added in the future are easier
    to implement.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, caption=One possible way to use macro annotations to automatically generate code in listing 4.]
@memoizing
case class Plus(left: Term, right: Term) extends Term {
    // The reduce method may be used by the macro to generate
    // AST reductions.
    def reduce(e0: Term, e1: Term) = (e0, e1) match {
        case (t0, Zero) => Some(t0)
        case (Zero, t1) => Some(t1)
        case (IntLiteral(n0), IntLiteral(n1)) =>
            Some(IntLiteral(n0 + n1))
        case _ => None
    }
}
        \end{lstlisting}
