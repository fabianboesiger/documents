    \section{Introduction} \label{introduction}
    Abstract syntax trees (AST) are used in compilers and similar programs to represent
    the structure of a program as a tree data structure. As with any other tree structure,
    ASTs can be traversed, searched, transformed and so forth. During such operations,
    subtrees within the AST are potentially checked for equality many times.  Moreover, equality checks
    also occur in operations on collections of AST subtrees, for example in finding
    a specific subtree, which may add an additional performance overhead.
    
    Because ASTs represent the structure of programs, equality checks usually happen on a structural level.
    Structural equality checking of subtrees is done recursively as we have to compare not only the roots, but also their children. This may add unexpected performance costs,
    especially considering the depth of ASTs representing big programs.

    Many operations on ASTs, including equality checks, have to be implemented for
    every AST node type individually. But these implementations usually follow a simple
    pattern and only differ in the arity and type of the node's parameters. Such repetitve
    code is generally known as boilerplate code and should be reduced to a minimum, for example
    with automatic code generation using metaprogramming techniques.

    The goal of this thesis is to improve the performance of AST subtree equality checks
    without burdening developers with additional boilerplate implementations.
    
    \section{Background}

    \subsection{Viper and Silicon} \label{background:viper}
    
    Viper \cite{viper} is a verification infrastructure on top of which verification tools
    for different programming languages can be built. Silicon \cite{silicon} is a backend for Viper,
    which is based on symbolic execution. To advance program verification in practice,
    fast verification is cruicial as it provides a more streamlined experience for developers.
    This is the reason why one of Silicon's stated goals is performance:

    \begin{quote} 
        ``The verifier should enable an IDE-like experience: it should be
        sufficiently fast such that users can continuously work on verifying
        programs [...]'' \cite{silicon}
    \end{quote}

    Silicon internally builds an AST from the Viper input
    program. This AST is potentially checked for structural equality many times within
    the execution of Silicon, and as such has the properties described in section \ref{introduction}.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, caption=Example of multiple subtree (``term'') equality checks occuring during the execution of Silicon.]
// args is of type Seq[Term], meaning we compare a list of
// terms within a sort function which is called many times
// during the sorting process.
relevantChunks.sortWith((ch1, ch2) => {
        // ... &&
        ch1.args == args
})
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsection{Scala and IntelliJ} \label{background:scala}

    The Viper infrastructure is written in the Scala programming language.
    Scala has support for metaprogramming using macros. For a nice programming experience
    using macros, IDE support should ideally be provided. In this case, we use the IntelliJ IDE.
    However, Scala macros are not supported natively by the IntelliJ IDE:
    \begin{quote}
        ``Since IntelliJ IDEA’s coding assistance is based on static code analysis,
        the IDE is not aware of AST changes, and can’t provide appropriate code
        completion and inspections for the generated code.'' \cite{intellij}
    \end{quote}

    To ensure support for macros, a macro-specific IntelliJ plugin would have to be developed such that
    IntelliJ properly picks up macro-generated code.

    \section{Approach} \label{approach}

    \subsection{Implementation of Flyweight ASTs} \label{approach:flyweight}

    In a first step, we evaluate the performance of the Silicon backend,
    which allows us to relate possible performance improvements to 
    changes made during this project. We use existing benchmarking infrastructure 
    and, if necessary, create new benchmarks and benchmarking tools.

    We can't avoid equality checks themselves, but what we can do is implementing
    equality checks in a more performant way. Currently in Silicon, new term instances are
    created independetly of already existing ones, which potentially leads 
    to the coexistence of multiple structurally equal term instances. Subterm equality is checked in a
    structural and recursive manner.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, caption={Simplification of how term instances currently are
    implemented. Because \texttt{Plus} is defined as a case class, the compiler automatically
    generates code for recursive structural equality checking.}]
case class Plus(val p0: Term, val p1: Term) extends Term
\end{lstlisting}
        
    Because the AST used in Silicon is immutable, we can utilize the flyweight pattern \cite{patterns} on AST terms.
    To do this, we maintain a pool of term instances. Whenever a term
    is to be created, we first compare the components of this new term with our
    pool of existing terms. If a term with the same components already exists, we return it and
    avoid creating a new instance of this term. Otherwise, we create a new term and add it to
    the pool.

    This gives us the guarantee that there are no two instances of the
    same term in our pool, meaning every two structurally equal terms point to the same
    underlying object in memory. Comparing terms for structural equality then boils
    down to a cheap reference equality check, and recursive equality checks can be avoided.
    
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, caption=Avoid instantiating multiple structurally equal terms using the flyweight pattern.]
class Plus private (left: Term, right: Term) extends Term {
    // ...
}

object Plus extends ((Term, Term) => Plus) {
    // Pool object which holds our "Plus" terms.
    var pool = new HashMap[(Term, Term), Plus]

    def apply(e0: Term, e1: Term) = {
        pool.get((e0, e1)) match {
            // If this term already exists in pool, return it. 
            case Some(term) => term
            // Otherwise, create a new instance.
            case None =>
                val term = new Plus(e0, e1)
                pool.addOne((e0, e1), term)
                term
        }
    }

    // ...
}
    \end{lstlisting}

    The \texttt{Plus} constructor is now private, which makes it impossible to
    create \texttt{Plus} instances without checking the pool first. The companion
    object \texttt{Plus} now contains a pool of all existing \texttt{Plus} instances. Furthermore,
    \texttt{Plus} is no longer a case class, which means that the default \texttt{equals}
    method no longer recursively checks for structural equality, but instead
    simply does a reference equality check. Because Scala's equality operator (\texttt{==})
    and datastructures such as \texttt{HashMap} use the \texttt{equals} method behind
    the scenes, this will most likely lead to performance improvements.

    \subsection{Automate Boilerplate Generation using Macros} \label{approach:macros}

    Silicon's AST representation of the Viper language consists of nearly 100 different terms,
    all with boilerplate implementations for different operations, as discussed in section \ref{introduction}.
    Our changes introdroduce additional boilerplate code to each term companion object, as seen in the case
    of the \texttt{Plus} term in listing 3.

    Our ASTs shouldn't only be flyweight in the sense of the implementation pattern, but also
    regarding development time and effort. This is why we want to avoid such boilerplate
    code and instead automatically generate companion objects seen in listing 3 using Scalas macro annotations.
    Additional benefits of using macro annotations include improvements in code
    readability and maintainability. Experimenting with code changes will become a matter
    of editing a single macro instead of editing each term individually.
    Terms which may be added in the future are easier to implement.

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, caption=One possible way to use macro annotations to automatically generate code in listing 3.]

        \end{lstlisting}

        described in section \ref{approach:macros}.
        %\\\textit{4 Weeks}  
        \item \textbf{Ensure IntelliJ IDE support} for our macro annotations as
        discussed in section \ref{background:scala}.
        %\\\textit{4 Weeks}
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Extension Goals}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Profiling parts of Silicon that perform many operations on
        terms. Possibly adapt such parts to better utilize performance improvements
        regarding equality checks, some datastructures for example may perform better
        over others with fast equality checks. Evaluate performance improvements.
        \item Investigate if the same approach as discussed in
        section \ref{approach} can be applied to the Viper AST.
        If possible, implement our approach and evaluate the changes made.
        \item Research, implement and evaluate ways to extend AST simplifications as a furter step to increase performance.
        \texttt{Plus(t, IntLiteral(0))} for example can be directly simplifed to \texttt{t}.
        Usage of a domain-specific language in combination with Scala macros to auto-generate AST
        simplifications. This would allow to easily add or modify
        AST reductions in the future.
