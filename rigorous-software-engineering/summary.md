# Rigorous Software Engineering

## Requirements Elicitation

### Requirements

Requirements define features that the system must have or a constraint that it must satisfy to be accepted by the client.

The result should be a requirements specification that defines:

* Functional Requirements
  * Functionality (Relationship of outputs to inputs, exact sequence of operations, validity checks)
  * Environmental conditions (Interfaces)
  * User interaction
  * Error handling
* Nonfunctional Requirements
  * Performance
    * Static Numerical Requirements (Number of terminals supported, number of simultaneous users, ...)
    * Dynamic Numerical Requirements (Number of transactions within a certain time period)
  * Attributes (Portability, Correctness, Security ...)
  * Design Constraints
* Pseudo Requirements
  * Implementation Requirements
  * Legal Requirements

It does not define:

* System structure
* Implementation technology
* System design
* Development methodology

Requirements should be:

* Correct
* Consistent
* Complete
* Clear
* Realistic
* Verifiable
* Traceable

Requirements are usually validated using:

* Reviews
* Prototypes

### Activities

#### Identifying Actors

* Which user groups are supported by the system?
* Which user groups execute the systemâ€™s main functions?
* Which user groups perform secondary functions (maintenance, administration)?
* With what external hardware and software will the system interact?

#### Identifying Scenarios

A narrative description of what people do and experience as they try to make use of computer systems and applications.

* What are the tasks the actor wants the system to perform?
* What information does the actor access'
* Which external changes does the actor need to inform the system about? 
* Which events does the system need to inform the actor about?

#### Identifying Use Cases

A list of steps describing the interaction between an actor and the system, to achieve a goal.

#### Identifying Nonfunctional Requirements

Nonfunctional requirements are defined together with functional requirements because of dependencies, they typically contain conflicts.

## Informal Modeling

## Formal Modeling

### Alloy

### Modularity

#### Coupling

* Low coupling is a general design goal
* Each module should have a clear responsibility
* The code should still be performant and convienient
* Some design patterns increase adaptability

##### Data Coupling

Modules get coupled by operation on shared data structures (Databases, Files).

Problems

* Changes in data structure
* Unexpected side effects (sharing by reference)
* Concurrency

Approaches

* Restricting Access to data
  * No leaking of references, clone if necessary
  * No capturing, don't store arguments as sub-object
* Making shared data immutable
  * Simplifies multi-threading
  * Easier to maintain invariants
  * Less unexpected side effects
  * Flyweight pattern
* Avoiding shared data
  * Pipe-and-filter style, no shared state, usable for streaming

##### Procedural Coupling

Modules are coupled to other modules whose methods they call.

Problems

* Change in callee may require changes in callee

Approaches

* Moving code,
  * Duplicating functionality to avoid dependencies
* Event-based style
  * Observer pattern
    * Subject has list of observers, notifies them if an event occurs, observers decide how to handle the event
    * Model-view-controller architecture
* Restricting calls
  * Enforce a policy that restricts which other modules a module may call

##### Class Coupling

Inheritance couples the subclass to the superclass.

Problems

* Changes in the superclass may break the subclass
* Limited options for other inheritance relations
  * Language only supports single inheritance
  * May cause conflichts with multiple inheritance
  
Approaches:

* Replacing inheritance with aggregation
* Using interfaces
  * Data structures can be changed without affecting the code
* Delegating allocations
  * Dependency injection
    * Dependencies between classes are defined in a separate configuration file
  * Factories
    * Delegate allocations to a dedicated class using an abstract factory
    * Different concrete factories are used to make objects of different classes
    * The concrete factory can be chosen by the client

```java
// Abstract factory.
interface MapFactory<K, V> {
  Map<K, V> make();
}

// Concrete factory.
class TreeMapFactory implements MapFactory<K, V> {
  Map<K, V> make() {
    return new TreeMap<K, V>();
  }
}

class SymbolTable {
  Map<Ident, Type> types;

  // Client chooses what concrete factory is used to generate the types map.
  SymbolTyble(MapFactory<Ident, Type> f) {
    types = f.make();
  }
}
```

#### Adaption

* Software systems can be prepared for change by allowing clients to influence their behavior
* Designing adaptable modules makes inevitable changes easier
* Adaptable modules facilitate reuse

##### Parametrization

Make modules parametric in:

* The values they manipulate
* The data structures they operate on
* The types they operate on
* The algorithms they apply

#### Specialization

In object-oriented programs, behaviors can be specialized via overriding and dynamic method binding.

Overriding

```java
class Merger<D> {
  Filter<D>[] filters;
  int next;
  Selector<D> s;

  D getNext() {
    D res = null;
    do {
      res = filters[next].getNext();
    } while (!s.select(res));
    next = (next + 1) % filters.length;
    return res;
  }
}
```

Drawbacks

* Subclasses share responsibility for maintaining invariants
* Increases number of possible behaviors that need to be tested
* Makes it harder to evolve code without breaking subclasses
* Performance overhead of method look-up at runtime

Dynamic Method Binding

* Can be used together with aggregation (state pattern)

```java
if (s instanceof NonNullSelector) {
  s.NonNullSelector::select(res);
} else
if (s instanceof TimeStampSelector) {
  s.TimeStampSelector::select(res);
}
// Additional cases can be defined without changing the code.
```
