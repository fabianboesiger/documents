## Dirac Notation

## Rules of Quantum Mechanics

### States

The quantum state space is a hilbert space, that is:

1. a complex vector space 2. which posesses an inner product

#### Finite Dimensions

> **Example**
>
> A qubit lives in the space spanned by the basis $\{\ket{0}, \ket{1}\}$.

#### Infinite Dimensions

$$\ket{\psi} = \int \limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi(x) \ket{x} dx$$

### Measurements

Measurements can be represented via projectors:

$$\mathcal{M} = \{P_0, \dots, P_n\} \quad P_i^2 = P_i \quad  \sum \limits_i P_i = 1$$
