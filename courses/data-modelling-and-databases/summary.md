## Relational Model

#### Database Schema

A set of relation schemas.

#### Relation Schema

A name and a set of fields/attributes.

For a relation $R(f_1: D_1, \dots, f_n: D_n)$, an Instance $I_R$ is a set of tuples $I_R \subseteq D_1 \times \cdots \times D_n$.

#### Fields/Attributes

A name and a domain (e.g. Integer, String).

#### Primary Keys

There can be no duplicate keys, each key identifies an entry uniquely. Primary keys can consist of multiple fields.

#### Secondary Keys



### Relational Algebra

Relational algebra is an imperative way of obtaining the data. It is step-by-step instructions on how to obtain the result.

#### Basic Operators

* Union: $\cup$
* Difference: $-$
* Selection: $\sigma$
* Projection: $\Pi$
* Cartesion Product: $\times$
* Renaming: $\rho$

#### Joins

##### Natural Join

$R_1(A, B) \Join R_2(B, C) = \Pi_{A, B, C}(\sigma_{R_1.B = R_2.B}(R_1 \times R_2))$

If $R_1$ and $R_2$ have no shared attributes, $R_1 \Join R_2 = R_1 \times R_2$.

If $R_1$ and $R_2$ share all attributes, $R_1 \Join R_2 = R_1 \cap R_2$.

##### Theta Join

$R_1 \Join_\theta R_2 = \sigma_\theta(R_1 \times R_2)$

##### Equi-Join

$R_1 \Join_{A=B} R_2 = \sigma_{A=B}(R_1 \times R_2)$

##### Semi-Join

$R_1(A_1, \dots, A_n) \ltimes_C R_2(B_1, \dots, B_m) = \Pi_{A_1, \dots, A_n}(R_1 \Join R_2)$

#### Relational Division

$R \div S = T$, where $T$ is the largest relation such that $S \times T \subseteq R$.

$R \div S = \Pi_{R-S} R - \Pi_{R-S}((\Pi_{R-S} R) \times S - R)$

### Relational Calculus

Relational Calculus queries data in a declarative way. It tells the system what we want instead of how to get it.

Example: Get all students who take the database course.

$\Pi_\text{PersNr} \sigma_{\text{Title}=\text{"Database"}}((\text{Student} \Join \text{Attends}) \Join \text{Lecture})$

Is equivalent to:

$\{p: \exists n, s . \text{Student}(p, n, s) \land \exists l,t,c,r (\text{Attends}(p, l) \land \text{Lecture}(l, t, c, r) \land t = \text{"Database"})\}$

#### Safety

We say a relational calculus query $Q$ is safe, if $Q(I)$ is finite for all instances $I$. An unsafe example would be $\{x \mid \lnot R(x)\}$. The safety problem is undecidable.

## SQL

### Create Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE professor (
    pers_nr INTEGER,
    name    VARCHAR(32),
    level   CHARACTER(2) DEFAULT "AP",
    PRIMARY KEY (pers_nr)
)
```

## Entity Relationship Model

### Entity Relationship to Relational Model

## Database System Overview

## Transactions and ACID

### Isolation and Locking

Every transaction starts with `BEGIN` and ends with either `COMMIT` or `ABORT`. If `COMMIT`, all changes are saved, if `ABORT`, all changes are undone.

#### Serializability Classes

##### Serializable

Schedules that lead to the same answer as some serial schedules.

```text
                                10, 10
Read(A, t)
t := t + 100
Write(A, t)                     110, 10
                Read(A, s)
                s := s * 2
                Write(A, s)     220, 10
Read(B, t)
t := t + 100
Write(B, t)                     220, 110
                Read(B, s)
                s := s * 2
                Write(B, s)     220, 220
```

##### Conflict Serializable

We can translate a schedule into a serial shedule with a sequence of nonconflicting swaps of adjacent actions.

Types of Conflicts:

* Read-Write Conflict
* Write-Read Conflict
* Write-Write Conflict

#### Locking

##### Two-Phase Locking

Growing Phase:

* Each transaction requests the locks that it needs
* Locks cannot be released in this phase

Shrinking Phase:

* The transaction is only allowed to release locks that it previously required
* The transaction cannot acquire new locks

###### Cascading Abort



##### Serial

Transactions are serial.

```text
                                10, 10
Read(A, t)
t := t + 100
Write(A, t)                     110, 10
Read(B, t)
t := t + 100
Write(B, t)                     110, 110
                Read(A, s)
                s := s * 2
                Write(A, s)     220, 110
                Read(B, s)
                s := s * 2
                Write(B, s)     220, 220
```

### Recovery

#### Recoverability Classes

##### Recoverable

If $T_i$ reads from $T_j$ and commits, then $c_j < c_i$.

##### Avoids Cascading Aborts

If $T_i$ reads $X$ from $T_j$, then $c_j < r_i[X]$.

##### Strict

If $T_i$ reads from or overwrites $X$ written by $T_j$, then $(c_j < r_i[X] \land c_j < w_i[X]) \lor (a_j < r_i[X] \land a_j < w_i[X])$.
